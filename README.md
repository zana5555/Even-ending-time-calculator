# Even ending time calculator
a simple code able to evaluate the end time of a period of time, given as a number of minutes (it could be arbitrarily large). The start time is given as a pair of hours (0..23) and minutes (0..59). The result has to be printed to the console.  For example, if an event starts at 12:17 and lasts 59 minutes, it will end at 13:16.
